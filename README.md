Using public data from the US DoT website, write a script or a series of scripts to answer the questions that follow.
  1. List the code of the airlines most at fault for the delays in cities that exceed the 95th percentile of delayed departures between 75 to 89 minutes during the month of January 2015.
  2. Create a visualisation to demonstrate your results. (use whatever you like)
  3. Compute the percentage that those airlines most at fault contribute to the total number of delays.

# Prompt 2:

Two drones, A and B, that travel together are used to detect and locate people in distress in a large area of forest land. The detectability of drone A is 0.8 ( that is, the probability that a person in distress will be detected by drone A is 0.8), whereas the detectability of drone B is 0.9. However, when a person in distress has been detected their location may not be pinpointed accurately by either drone. Based on a detection from drone A alone, the location of the distressed individual can be accurately determined with probability 0.7, whereas the corresponding probability with drone B alone is only 0.4. If a person in distress is detected by both drones, their location can be pinpointed with certainty. Determine the the probability of accurately locating a distressed individual.
